# Quality Assurance

Quality assurance (QA) is an integral part of any analytical project. It helps ensure that decision making is done with an understanding of the evidence and risks, and helps to ensure that the integrity of any analytical outputs. For the team, it also helps to reduce the reputational damage associated with backtracking on findings due to errors. There is also a NHS England Business Critical Model processes which should be followed where appropriate. Further details can be found on the intranet.

There are different activities that can be undertaken to assist with the QA process. A project may necessitate a combination of these, with QA requirements elicited during the project planning phase to enable adequate time to advertise and secure relevant people to advise or undertake the QA. It is important that the **QA operates throughout the model lifecycle**, rather than something to undertake at the conclusion of a project.

To enable successful QA of all analysis, all code should be developed in a manner which enables this QA to take place, adhering to best practice. This allows those performing the QA to do so in an efficient and comprehensive manner.

| Type | Description | Timeframe | Characteristics |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Internal QA | Individual(s) within the team conduct the QA | At appropriate stages of the analysis, before results are presented to key stakeholders | Review of the code, analytical approach etc. |
| External QA | Individual(s) external to the team, but internal to the organization | At the conclusion of the development | Review of the code, analytical approach etc |
| Academic input | Academic(s) who may have expertise in the area of the analysis | During the project | Input into the analytical approach, methods and theory. Does not involve a review of the code-base or outputs |
| Clinical input | Clinician(s) such as NHS England clinical advisors | During development | Checking clinical validity of findings (where relevant) |
| Econometrics & Data Science User Group | NHS England colleagues | During development | A forum in which to discuss methodological approaches, and recieve input from others in the organization |
| NHSE Business Critical Model | See guidance | See guidance |See guidance |

## Academic input

For more complex analyses involving economic theory or econometrics, academic input can be highly valuable. These can provide additional learning to the team, and ensure the corrrect analytical approach and theories are used. It can also provide reassurances to (senior) stakeholders on the findings, helping to land the project with impact. Academic conferences, such as the Health Economics Study Group (HESG) also provide a forum to discuss analyses, which can also help raise the profile of the team within the academic world. Any input should be prioritized in line with usual procedures.

## Clinical input

Where relevant, any analysis undertaken should be **clinically relevant**. Clinicians are able to provide on-the-ground experience and knowledge, and can inform areas to explore, how certain processes work, and assist in interpreting results, for example whether findings are plausible or a statistical anomaly, and what factors could explain a certain finding. The team have worked closely with Regional Clinical Advisors on the A&E crowding project, and presented to their forums.
