# Managing Analytical Projects

## Project Management Tools



### Processes

#### Analytical Tasks

#### Error/Miscalculation Log

Any errors or miscalculates identified within the development stage should be logged accordingly. These can be recorded in the 'development' task app in MS Teams, or the 'Issues' tab within GitHub. Both these platforms allow the issue to be assigned to an individual, who will take responsibility for correcting it, and once doing so, can check this off. This mitigates the risk that previously identified errors filter through to final results shared with stakeholders.
